ABOUT

PHPCLIBrowser is a python3 script that provides a browser window capable to run
php cli (bash php) scripts. As result one may build user interfaces using HTML 
and HTML forms and process them with PHP locally. It does not require any server 
and doesn't run any server. It uses PHP CLI commands only.
